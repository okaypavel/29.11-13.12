        <p class="text-main padding-text">
            After about 50 hours in game I've decided to "share some wisdom." Stuff that I've found out through
            experimentation to enhance the ETS2 experience. It was hard to find a decent guide on Google so I initially
            created a forum discussion for this, but it was suggested that I create a guide instead, so here it is.

            This guide is focused more at new-ish players, but hopefully even folks that have been playing for a while
            will get something out of it.</p>

        <p class="text-main padding-text">Cruise control. Use it. I played about 20 hours without it and I can't even
            guess how many
            speeding violations I
            got or how many times out of fear of getting them I travelled under the speed limit costing me time. Or how
            many
            times the distraction of having to constantly check my speed caused me to wander over the lines.</p>

        <p class="text-main padding-text">Building on that, set your cruise tolerance to zero, turn on auto retarder.
            You can safely
            travel up to 9 kph
            over the posted speed limit without getting cited. So set your cruise to 6 or 7 over the limit and travel at
            max
            efficiency without risking tickets. *Note: It's been brought to my attention that the actual safe limit may
            be
            10% over the speed limit. Have not verified.*</p>

        <p class="text-main padding-text">Watch the speed limit signs though, especially in areas where speed cameras
            are common.
            Running with cruise
            control it's easy to get in the zone and miss a speed limit sign. Speeding tickets suck.</p>

        <p class="text-main padding-text">Sleep efficiency. There is no such thing as a partial rest. Every time you
            rest it's going
            to burn 8 hours, even
            if you're not that tired yet. Start looking for a place to park after the first yawn, no sooner. You'll be
            fine.
            Don't bother sleeping between jobs unless the job selection where you're at is lousy or your rest meter is
            nearly pegged. (Hit F6 to see exactly how much longer you have before you get sleepy) Most jobs will allot
            you
            enough time to sleep once, especially after you put a few points in the long distance skill, which you'll
            want
            to do early on. For the really long jobs you'll have time to sleep 2 or 3 times and have time to spare for
            checking out new towns along your route. As of this writing you don't get a bonus for delivering cargo
            early, so
            sleep on the clock.</p>

        <p class="text-main padding-text">Some toll plazas have EZPass lanes. You don't have to go to green squares and
            stop at most
            plazas. You can slow
            to 30 kph and breeze on through the EZPass lanes, so watch for those, there will be nothing blocking the
            close
            end and a red "30" or whatever above the entrance. They take a lot of the pain out of toll plazas.</p>

        <p class="text-main padding-text">Miss your exit? Well... You won't be penalized for driving the wrong way on
            the shoulder.
            If it's too far to the
            next exit and going to take too long, just carefully pull a u-turn, get on the shoulder, and head back the
            way
            you came. Slightly terrifying, but better than wasting hours going out of your way trying to get back on the
            right path. Also note that if you turn slowly enough you can actually push cars blocking your trailer
            without
            causing damage. But you have to turn ever so slowly.</p>

        <p class="text-main padding-text">Try not to fuel in the UK. It's way more expensive than on the mainland. Fuel
            before you
            cross the channel.</p>

        <p class="text-main padding-text">Never travel empty, or "bobtail." When you go to job selection, click on the
            dot on the map
            for the city you're
            in. This will list ONLY jobs originating in that city. If there are no high paying jobs, just grab a short
            distance job to a nearby city and try again there. And remember, $ per km is what you're after, don't just
            grab
            the highest total payout.</p>

        <p class="text-main padding-text">On the same topic, the payout listed includes any skill bonuses for cargo
            type, etc. It's
            like sales tax in the
            EU. Included. What you see on the price tag is what you pay. What you see includes your bonuses. The math is
            done for you.</p>

        <p class="text-main padding-text">One additional tip on efficiency: On long trips you can and probably should
            edit your
            route. Open your world map
            once you've picked up a job and drop pins (waypoints) in towns right near your route that you haven't
            explored
            yet to unlock the truck dealerships and recruiters there. The little time it takes won't make you run late
            on
            the long jobs. You can also avoid 60 km speed limit country roads in Germany and manually choose to travel
            on
            the autobahn instead. Watch the upper left corner to see how much time you're saving. Remember, there's no
            penalty for arriving early. You can only drop 10 pins at a time though so if you run out, remember to stop
            and
            update your trip once you get to the last one.</p>
